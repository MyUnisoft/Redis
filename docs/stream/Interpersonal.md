  idleTime: number;
}

interface GroupConsumerOptions extends BasementOptions {
  groupName: string;
  consumerName: string;
  claimOptions?: ClaimOptions;
}
```

## ðŸ“š Usage

```ts
const consumer = new GroupConsumer({
  streamName: "my-stream-name",
  groupName: "my-group-name",
  consumerName: "my-consumer-name",
  frequency: 10000, 
  lastId: ">",
  count: 10,
  claimOptions: {
    idleTime: 1000 * 60
  }
});

const readable = Readable.from(firstConsumer[Symbol.asyncIterator]());
readable.on("readable", async() => {
  const chunk: Entry[] = readable.read();

  for (const entry of chunk) {
    await firstConsumer.claimEntry(entry.id);
  }
});
```
